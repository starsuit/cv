          Current student at Founders and Coders, learning full-stack web
          development. I&#39;m a Psychology graduate with a 2:1 honours degree
          from the University of Reading, and previously worked in data analysis
          for four years. I am proficient in MS Excel and Access, with some
          self-taught VBA and SQL. I know a smattering of Python.

          <a href="https://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders and Coders</a>
          are a non-profit based in Finsbury Park, London. They run peer-led web
          development courses which are free but highly selective.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Founders and Coders I&#39;m learning full stack web development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML and CSS</li>
          <li>Accessibility and design</li>
          <li>Git and GitHub</li>
          <li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
          <li>Test-driven development (TDD)</li>
          <li>npm and Node</li>
          <li>HTTP server development</li>
          <li>PostgreSQL databases</li>
          <li>Hosting applications on Heroku</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is a heavy focus on cooperation and all our coding is done by
          pair programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;m looking forward to learning about authentication, Express and
          React in the coming weeks, as well as gaining some experience working
          on some exciting

        <h3 id="data-manager-at-vyners-school-academy-trust-122015---032019">
          Data Manager at Vyners School Academy Trust (12/2015 - 03/2019)
        </h3>
        <p>
          My role at Vyners School involved collecting and analysing student
          performance data for target setting, reporting to senior leadership
          and sending parent reports home. I was responsible for maintaining
          pupil data, collecting marks and importing exam results. I gained a
          lot of experience in MS Excel and Google Sheets, using VBA and Google
          Apps Script to create dynamic reports and data visualisations.
          Eventually I realised I enjoyed writing these &#39;apps&#39; so much,
          I wanted to learn code and write them for the web!

          Data Migration Analyst at Xerox (03/2015 - 12/2015)
        </h3>
        <p>
          I was originally hired to cleanse and manage qualification related
          data within the data system SAP. As I learned more and more on the job
          about Microsoft Access, I took more initiative and soon was providing
          front end solutions for employees and managers to access and transfer
          data, as well as my original data management and analyst
          responsibilities. As well as producing several tools to facilitate
          data access, entry and understanding, I was responsible for producing
          and sending out reports to employees and managers.
