## Founders and Coders

[Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) are a non-profit based in Finsbury Park, London. They run peer-led web development courses which are free but highly selective.

At Founders and Coders I'm learning full stack web development:

- HTML and CSS
- Accessibility and design
- Git and GitHub
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- npm and Node
- HTTP server development
- PostgreSQL databases
- Hosting applications on Heroku

There is a heavy focus on cooperation and all our coding is done by pair programming.

I'm looking forward to learning about authentication, Express and React in the coming weeks, as well as gaining some experience working on some exciting [tech for better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/techforbetter/) projects with my fellow students.

## Skills

(proof I am a somewhat well-rounded human being)

- Pixelart in Excel (this led to pixelart in [svg format](https://codepen.io/Starsuit/pen/OrOOrP))
- Making little robots (they mainly just [crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7vp6YrCuWA))
- Baking sourdough (I have a pet sourdough starter named Herbert)
- Art - I love to paint and draw

Looking at this list, I think I just like making things.

## Experience

### Data Manager at Vyners School Academy Trust (12/2015 - 03/2019)

My role at Vyners School involved collecting and analysing student performance data for target setting, reporting to senior leadership and sending parent reports home. I was responsible for maintaining pupil data, collecting marks and importing exam results. I gained a lot of experience in MS Excel and Google Sheets, using VBA and Google Apps Script to create dynamic reports and data visualisations. Eventually I realised I enjoyed writing these 'apps' so much, I wanted to learn code and write them for the web!

### Data Migration Analyst at Xerox (03/2015 - 12/2015)

I was originally hired to cleanse and manage qualification related data within the data system SAP. As I learned more and more on the job about Microsoft Access, I took more initiative and soon was providing front end solutions for employees and managers to access and transfer data, as well as my original data management and analyst responsibilities. As well as producing several tools to facilitate data access, entry and understanding, I was responsible for producing and sending out reports to employees and managers.
